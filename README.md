# Digtial-Health-Tracker
This project monitors vital signs—heartbeat rate and body temperature—via sensors linked to an Arduino Uno and ESP32 Wi-Fi module. Data is sent to cloud platforms like ThingSpeak and Google Sheets for remote analysis by healthcare providers. It includes an emergency panic button for instant alerts via email or SMS, enhancing patient safety.
